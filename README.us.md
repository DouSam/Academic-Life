<h1 align="center">Academic Projects</h1>

<p align="justify">Here are some exercises, tests and assignments that I have done during my undergraduate studies. Many files may not be commented or organized because I am still fixing the repository. If you are looking for a specific non-academic but commercial project, check the other repositories!</p>

<p align="justify">Basically each folder is an educational institution that I attended or am currently attending, within them are its semesters, subjects, and the programs I developed for them.</p>
